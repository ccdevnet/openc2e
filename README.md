# New development at [openc2e/openc2e](https://github.com/openc2e)

After chatting with fuzzie, bdonlan, nornagon, and diagonalfish, it seems there's no longer any way to access this repository.

I've created a new GitHub Organization and repository at [openc2e/openc2e](https://github.com/openc2e) for new development.

At the time of writing, changes include:
- Making it build on modern systems, with SDL2, Qt5, Python instead of Perl, and no more Boost
- Simple builds on Windows (just open in Visual Studio!)
- New dev tools (praybuilder, etc) built on file format code
- Other updates

If you're interested in contributing or running openc2e, please join me there!
