* do mulv/divv/etc set the correct type bitmap on the variable?
* implement ENUM/ESEE/ETCH/EPAS/NEXT
* look at the room code
* make the images detect 555/565 themselves
* start implementing physics
* look at starting the sound code (and integrating SDL_mixer)
* comparison should be 'condition', fuzzie sucks, regexp time!
