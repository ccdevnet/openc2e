* do mulv/divv/etc set the correct type bitmap on the variable?
* implement ENUM/ESEE/ETCH/EPAS/NEXT
* look at the room code
* make the images detect 555/565 themselves
* start implementing physics
* look at starting the sound code (and integrating SDL_mixer)
* make the tokeniser work out command vs function stuff itself
  * .. and then remove it from the runtime (eg, we don't need seperate cmd/func)
