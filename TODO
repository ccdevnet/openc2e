* implement ENUM/ESEE/ETCH/EPAS/NEXT
* look at the room code
* start implementing agent event script infrastructure
* start implementing physics
* look at starting the sound code (and integrating SDL_mixer)
* look at using mmap() for backgrounds, to save memory. to do this, we might have to write an endian-swapper.
* make the tokeniser work out command vs function stuff itself
  * .. and then remove it from the runtime (eg, we don't need seperate cmd/func)
