* 'Just type make' build system

* if you add a CAOS function, you need to:
 * add prototype to caosVM.h
 * add implementation in a caosVM_category.cpp file
 * make sure you add documentation before the implementation in the same format as everything else
 * make sure it works, and add a %status done
