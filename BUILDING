* standard autoconf/automake/configure/make system.

* if you add a CAOS function, you need to:
 * add prototype to caosVM.h
 * add implementation in a caosVM_category.cpp file
 * make sure you add documentation before the implementation in the same format as everything else
 * run build.sh from caosdata/, this will:
  * regenerate the documentation
	* regenerate caosdata.cpp
	* generate perfect hashes, and from them caoshashes.h and caoshashes.cpp
	* copy all of the above back into the source tree
